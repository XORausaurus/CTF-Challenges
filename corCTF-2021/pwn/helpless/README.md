```
I thought February only had 28 days? How come it's already 2.34? Everything's weird these days.
I recently lost two of my best friends and I don't even have the keys to get into my House.
Could you make some new small keys for me? I really need help.

Everyone always jokes about osinting the author to solve challenges. This time osinting the author will definitely not solve the challenge, but it might still be a good idea :)
