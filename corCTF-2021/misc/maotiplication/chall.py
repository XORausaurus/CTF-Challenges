This interpreter takes a series of string substitutions and executes them on input strings sequentially.
Please enter your substitution rules in sequential order, one per line. Terminate your rules sequence with the string \'EOF\'. DO NOT SEND AN ACTUAL EOF.

The rule format is SEARCH:REPLACE. A double colon (SEARCH::REPLACE) can be used to create a terminating rule. If a terminating substitution rule is executed, the interpreter will not process any further substitutions.
If SEARCH is an empty string, then REPLACE will be inserted at the beginning of the input string instead.

For further clarification of interepter behavior, feel free to read the source.

For each round, a short description of the intended behavior will be provided. Additionally, several examples will be supplied. Your task is to devise a series of substitutions to accomplish this behavior.

Good luck!
