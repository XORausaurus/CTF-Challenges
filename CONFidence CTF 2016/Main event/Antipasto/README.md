The bug is in the `main()` function, which allows an arbitrary size to be passed to `ReadBytes()`, and in `ReadBytes()`, which does not verify the return value of the `read()` function (against -1). With these two things combined, it is possible to cause a static buffer underflow condition, which can be used to overwrite the `.got.plt` `write()` entry
with the address of shellcode, also in static memory (NX and PIE are both
disabled in this challenge).
