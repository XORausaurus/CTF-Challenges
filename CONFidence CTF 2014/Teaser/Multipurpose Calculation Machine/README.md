## Solution summary

<p>

Under specific conditions, `strncpy` doesn't nul-terminate the output buffer, leading to a format string vulnerability. [Our exploit](solution/exploit.py) uses it to leak the program base address, and overwrite the `exit` function pointer in `.got.plt` with the address of a `system("/bin/sh")` call found in the challenge, to get access to the shell.
