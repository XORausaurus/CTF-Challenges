If you want to continue playing at home, read this file. 

The entire needed files are in the archive "Subjects.tar.gz". You can continu playing at home with the board you've obtained from during our CTF.

If you need to reflash the board at it initial state, go to folder “LoadFirmware” and follow the instructions. It's a kind of help, because during the CTF you had to figure out yourleft this task.

Feel free to contact me on twitter ( @PagetPhil ) if you need some hints to go further.
