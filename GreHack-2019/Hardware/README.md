# Hardware Challenges

This folder contains all the source code of the 8 hardware challenge played during the CTF.

## Continue to play at home with the badge you get during the CTF :

If you want to continu playing, it's possible without spoiler.          
In this case, just open subfolder [CTF_at_home](CTF_at_home/) and you'll find the 8 subjects.             
The only difference is that I'm not here to do the firmware reloading, so my scripts are included in the folder. During the CTF you had to figure it out by yourself.           
Feel free to reach me on Twitter if you have questions or want some hints  --> @PagetPhil       

## The sources code :

Everything was done with the official Arduino's IDE for the firmwares and a Linux for the file encrypting or files generator.          
If you want to recompil the various firmwares, you must add all the [libraries](Sources/Libraries/) included in your arduino IDE.         

## Photos :

Just for fun, a few pictures taken during the project. Enjoy!                

## PCB (coming soon !) :

Will contains sources files for KiCAD, the GERBER files and the BOM.
