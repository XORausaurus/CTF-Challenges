While searching through a abandoned house that was said to be built on an ancient burial ground in which the owner had several spouses who died under mysterious circumstances until they themselves had disappeared from their office one day. 

Only thing left that was of significance was their desktop a Dell Computer with a model number of 666... only the D was replaced with an H. 

Also it was covered in ectoplasm and the house was super spooky. Blah, blah, blah, very scary. 

They made a CTF challenge and no one here is going NEAR it. YOU deal with it.
