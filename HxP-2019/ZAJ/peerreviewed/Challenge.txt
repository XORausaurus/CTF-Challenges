Because AES is so hard to understand, we went looking for something that is a
little easier to follow. This paper
(http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.333.3694&rep=rep1&type=pdf)

introduces an encrypted protocol that “prevents an attacker from recovering
the transmitted information through operations on the encrypted vectors
exchanged during the transmission procedure” - in fact, the paper even assures
us that “the only identified way one can compromise the protocol security is
by applying brute force attacks”. Since this is a peer-reviewed paper (by
subject-matter experts, no less) we can be sure that our data is safe! My
colleagues are still a bit concerned, though, so I am running this little test
in order to prove that the protocol is secure.
