I found some source code for a do-it-yourself flag printer but it looks like
it only builds using this weird cmake source. I tried everything I could think
of, i.e.

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

but it didn’t work :( I never understood that build system stuff so can you
please help me out?

(You should be able to safely ignore the *.h and *.c files Îre just to print
the flag when you succeed.)
