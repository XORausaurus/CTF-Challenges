Sick of Chick-fil-A, Daniel's son deserts him to make a break for the parking lot. (Un?)fortunately, Max the Mall Cop is here to help!
The n stores in the mall are connected by walkways such that none of them form a cycle; in other words, there is exactly one path from one store to another. Daniel's son was last seen at store k.
Stores connected to only one store lead to a parking lot. Max the Mall Cop decides to station his miniature clones at some of these parking lot stores.
Every minute, Daniel's son and the miniature Maxes can move one meter towards an adjacent store or stay put. Daniel's son is caught when he coincides with a miniature Max at a store or a walkway.
What is the minimum number of miniature Maxes that Max the Mall Cop should station to ensure that Daniel's son cannot reach a parking lot?

Input:
	First line: n, k
	Next n-1 lines:	a, b, x indicating a walkway between stores a and b with length x meters

Output:
	One line with the minimum miniature Maxes needed.
